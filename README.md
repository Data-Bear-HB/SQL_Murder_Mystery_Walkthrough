# SQL_Murder_Mystery_Walkthrough
A SQL game by @NUKnightLab

A murder has taken place. Who did it? You can query the databases and study schema to find out. It's fun.

**Summary** After looking at the types of data, and querying the tables with newly discovered information, act as a data detective to find out the murderer.

ðŸ“Œ This game uses SQL

ðŸ“Œ The walk-through is not strictly code, but logic explainations as well. Knight Lab has created their own walk-through for the game, but I wanted one very accessible to new SQL users.
