## **SQL Game from [Knight Lab] (https://mystery.knightlab.com/)** ##

# *First, study the schema*
(add Schema here)

# *Since it's a murder, open the crime_scene_report*

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report

# *Notice the city locations. One of them is 'SQL City'. That's probably the spot for a SQL murder.*
# Search by type 'murder' so you don't find other crimes

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';
